[Hearst Union](https://www.hearstmediaunion.org/) members working for Country Living and Veranda magazines walked out of their office in Birmingham's Pepper Place today, Thursday, March 23, 2023, at 12PM.

It's part of the workers' fight to get fair salary minimums and wage increases, better severance and time off, and stronger anti-harassment protections in writing.
