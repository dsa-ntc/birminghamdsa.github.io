<h5>Starbucks Workers United</h5>

For the last six months, Starbucks Workers United union delegates have been hard at work hammering out a contract that will benefit over 10,000 Starbucks workers. For three days out of each month, delegates travel to a central location to negotiate the details of the new contract. Up until recently, delegates and Starbucks corporate have been addressing non-economic changes, which includes things like dress code and store culture. They have now moved on to economic changes, which includes anything that has a financial impact, such as healthcare or pay. With the shift to economic negotiations, the stakes are higher than ever and Starbucks union members are prepared to fight. The local unionized Starbucks on 20th street is counting on Birmingham DSAâ€™s support. Further details to come.
