Our AfroSocialists & Socialists of Color Section ([AFROSOC](https://bhamdsa.org/our-work/#AFROSOC)) kicked off our 2024 by showing up, tabling, and speaking at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally with Cornel West! AFROSOC continued the year with monthly meetings and bimonthly socials, affirming a space for our BIPOC-identifying members to build power in Birmingham DSA and their communities. 

In February, we approved our Save Our Libraries campaign. In conjunction with our comrades at [North Alabama DSA](https://actionnetwork.org/groups/north-alabama-dsa), we pushed back against the censorship of LGBTQIA+ and racial justice materials in Alabama's public libraries, speaking in opposition to far-right groups at board meetings for North Shelby Library and the Alabama Public Library Service (APLS). We also organized write-ins in Shelby County and Tuscaloosa and online to overwhelm the APLS with anti-censorship letters.

Also in February, our [Palestine Working Group](https://bhamdsa.org/our-work/#palestineWG)] gathered outside pro-IDF musician Matisyahu's show at Saturn to let him know: He's not welcome in Birmingham (subsequent protests in the Southwest led to his shows being cancelled in Arizona and New Mexico). Following a March vigil for martyr Aaron Bushnell and a Nakba Day rally in May, we joined Palestine solidarity coalition organizations to pack a Birmingham City Council meeting. As a result, we successfully pressured our councilpeople to pass a ceasefire resolution (albeit a watered-down version of the original proposal).

On May Day, our [Labor Working Group](https://bhamdsa.org/our-work/#laborWG)] gathered to create solidarity signs and banners for Mercedes workers unionizing in Vance. We continued our labor solidarity by supporting striking AT&T workers on their summer picket lines, as well as organizing sip-ins in support of the [unionized Midtown Birmingham Starbucks](https://www.instagram.com/sbworkersunitedbham). Our members continued to develop their own workplace organizing skills by attending October's [Alabama Troublemakers School](https://www.alreporter.com/2024/10/21/troublemakers-school-teaches-alabamians-about-taking-on-the-boss-and-winning/).

We kicked off Pride Month in June with our Queer Socialists Section ([QueerSoc](https://bhamdsa.org/our-work/#QUEERSOC))'s first-ever meeting! Tabling at Central Alabama Pride (CAP)'s Pridefest and marching in CAP's Pride Parade, QueerSoc and chapter members handed out literature on how Israel "pinkwashes" their genocide of Palestinians. After disrupting multiple summer town hall meetings of transphobic Alabama politicians, QueerSoc closed out the year with a November Queersgiving potluck, a December gift swap, and a reading group for David Levithan's "Two¬†Boys¬†Kissing."
