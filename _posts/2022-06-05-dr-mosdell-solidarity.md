Central Jersey DSA stands with Piscataway school psychologist and DSA member, Dr. Cassia Mosdell. Dr. Mosdell has been effectively fired through the denial of tenure because of her advocacy for LGBTQ+ and other marginalized students. At the May 12th Piscataway Board of Education meeting, students and parents of students of Theodore Schor Middle School spoke about the [positive impact](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/education/2022/05/18/students-back-piscataway-educator-effort-overturn-non-tenure-decision/9788459002/) that Dr. Mosdell has on all students. Unfortunately, the Superintendent went through with his decision to deny tenure.

At a time when the LGBTQ+ community, especially children,  are under attack from those that would silence and erase them, Dr. Mosdell has been a cherished and powerful force for helping find their voice and identity. If the Board of Education does not overturn the Superintendent's decision to deny her tenure, her students risk losing a beloved advocate and counselor. We must protect both the LGBTQ+ community and those who work hard every day to keep them safe. Losing Dr. Mosdell would be devastating to a vulnerable community and would stifle such advocacy everywhere that educators fear to be the victims of this kind of retaliation.

We stand in solidarity with Dr. Mosdell and demand that the Board of Education and Superintendent reverse this decision. We encourage all community members who are alarmed at the prospect of “Don’t Say Gay” laws coming to New Jersey to join us at the June 9th Board of Education meeting. We need as many people as possible to show up in support of Dr. Mosdell and her students on June 9th and to be prepared for future mobilization in support.
