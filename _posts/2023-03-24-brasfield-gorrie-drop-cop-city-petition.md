Birmingham DSA has joined several of our allies on [BHAM SURJ](https://surj.org/chapter/birmingham-surj/)'s petition calling for Birmingham-based Brasfield & Gorrie to DROP themselves as general contractors of Atlanta's [Cop City](https://stopcop.city/).

Construction on Cop City is scheduled to begin soon -- so we need your help NOW!

Cop City is planned to be a police training facility that will teach urban warfare techniques to cops from all over the United States and the world.

This means police from all over Birmingham, Alabama, and the Southeast will, in the words of our comrade Mariah Parker from [Athens Area DSA](https://athensareadsa.org/), "send their police there to learn the state-of-the-art ways to beat the s*** out of you." 

The only way we as working-class people can stop this project -- a project that will facilitate our further control and exploitation at the hands of the [capitalists funding it](https://www.stopcopcitysolidarity.org/) -- is if we use our numbers, stand in solidarity with the rest of the working class, and act strategically to materially stop it.
