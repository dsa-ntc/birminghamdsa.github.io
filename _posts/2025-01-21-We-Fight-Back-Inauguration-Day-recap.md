On Monday, January 20th, Birmingham DSA joined Palestinian Christians of Alabama (PCA), Young Palestinians of Birmingham (YPB), and the Birmingham branch of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) at Linn Park for “We Fight Back!”, an Inauguration Day rally in opposition to Trump’s ultra-right, billionaire agenda.

Members from these organizations spoke on their organizing and issues that will be made worse with a second Trump administration.

Members from PSL spoke on the global climate catastrophe and the new administration’s commitment to fossil fuel production, the importance of standing up for our migrant neighbors in the face of xenophobic executive orders, and the need to fight back against the American military industrial complex.

Elizabeth from PCA spoke on the necessity of continuing to organize for the liberation of Palestine, and that the struggles of the Palestinian people are aligned with the struggles of oppressed people in Alabama and around the world.

And Jason K., a member of our Steering Committee, spoke on the importance of organizing to build working-class power under a two-party political system that only exists to serve the elite.

Eight years ago to the month, Birmingham DSA held its first public meeting to organize against the first Trump administration.

Now, we’re here once again, organizing against a second Trump administration. Joe Biden promised that as President, “nothing will fundamentally change” – and we think he certainly kept that promise.

But how will we win universal healthcare, reproductive justice, a free Palestine, earning what our labor is worth, and much more while Republicans and Democrats serve their corporate donors?

Birmingham DSA is here to organize a mass movement and transfer power from the ruling elite to the working class. Our power comes from you – so [join us today](https://dsausa.org/join).
