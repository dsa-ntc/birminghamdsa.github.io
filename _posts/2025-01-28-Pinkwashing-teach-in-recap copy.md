On Saturday, January 25th, our Queer Socialists Member Section (QueerSoc) hosted a [Pinkwashing](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/resource/pinkwashing/) Awareness teach-in at Red Bird Produce in the Avondale neighborhood of Birmingham.

Members from QueerSoc gave a presentation on how pinkwashing was a tool of colonial oppression. They also emphasized the need to center queer Palestinian voices, reject Israeli “savior” narratives, and connect the struggle to broader anti-colonial movements.

Layla Amar, an Atlanta-based artist, and Jawahir Kamil delivered heartfelt testimony to the century-long oppression they and their families have faced in Israel’s ongoing attack on Palestine.

Artwork honoring the lived experience of Palestinian and Lebanese people lined the entryway of the venue, including antique garments dating back to the early 1900's.

And one of the members of QueerSoc delivered compelling, spoken word poetry portraying their experience as an American Palestinian.

Birmingham DSA will continue to fight for a free Palestine and, through engaging with the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa communities, spread awareness and invite others to the movement.
