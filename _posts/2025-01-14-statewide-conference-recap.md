How do we further the power of working-class Alabamians? On Saturday, January 4, 2025, over 35 DSA and YDSA members from Birmingham, [North Alabama](https://actionnetwork.org/groups/north-alabama-dsa)], Montgomery, Mobile, [Tuscaloosa](https://www.instagram.com/ualeftists/), and even Jackson, Mississippi, came together at Saturn in Birmingham for [No Impostors!](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/18oiAbtjK3/), the first-ever Alabama DSA/YDSA statewide conference, to answer this question.

A few opening remarks from Birmingham DSA co-chair Jason K. were followed by keynote speaker, [RWDSU](https://www.rwdsu.org/) organizer, and former BAmazon Union worker-organizer Isaiah Thomas. In his speech, Isaiah discussed how an organizer is not just a leader leading the people out of capitalism...but a person bringing the power of labor together for everyone to move forward. 

Following the keynote speech was DSA’s “[Building a Mass Working Class Organization](https://www.dsausa.org/trainings/)” training, facilitated by Birmingham DSA member Chris I. In this training, members learned more about DSA’s goals, discussed the loneliness of individualist thinking, and looked at key features and strategies of other socialist organizations. 

During this training, Alabama DSA and YDSA leaders met in Saturn’s upstairs loft space for a first-ever <b>statewide leadership meeting</b>. Here, we shared our goals for the meeting, discussed what’s working and needing improvement in our chapters and organizing committees, and plotted next steps for making our infrastructure stronger.

After a break, training and leadership meeting attendees rejoined each other for a discussion on <b>electoral organizing</b> in Alabama. Facilitated by Birmingham DSA members Haley C. and Chris N., the discussion covered the state of the Alabama Democratic Party and how we can build working-class power in Alabama via elected office. At the end of the discussion, attendees split into groups to think critically on organizing an electoral campaign in Alabama that builds working-class power. 

Jason K. closed out the conference with thank yous and thoughts on using what we discussed to build socialism in Alabama and Mississippi. Attendees continued sharing thoughts and building connections over dinner and drinks afterwards.
