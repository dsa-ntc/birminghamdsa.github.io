  - about: "Birmingham DSA is an autonomous and democratically organized chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. 

The 240+ members of Birmingham DSA are building democracy powered by <em>us</em>, the working class, not the capitalist class. While capitalists may have the profits, we have the people -- and only through organizing ourselves can we wield that people power to create a government, economy, and society that's for and by us. 

Birmingham DSA's current projects include solidarity with organized labor and tenant unions, mutual aid, socialist feminist organizing, creating spaces for BIPOC socialists, and more."
