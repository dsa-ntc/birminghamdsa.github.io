You may feel compelled to boycott all products and companies tied in any way to Israel. There are many lists circulated on social media with hundreds of brands and companies, but these tend to be overwhelming and prevent boycotts from being effective. 

How do we make sure our actions have an impact? By strategically focusing on a small number of carefully selected companies and products. We need to target companies that play a clear and direct role in Israel’s crimes and where there is real potential for winning. 

We follow the BDS movement’s lead in strategically focusing on a small number of companies and products for maximum impact. For more information, see the [Guide to BDS Boycott and Pressure Corporate Priority Targetting](https://www.bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott) from the BDS Movement.

## What products are we boycotting? 

+ Sabra was founded by Strauss group, sponsor of the IOF and “authorized supplier” to the “defense ministry” and now owned by PepsiCo (also on the BDS list!)
+ Israeli wines, such as Carmel Winery, Golan Heights, Yarden, Barkan Wine Cellars, Dalton Winery, Jezreel Valley, Psagot, Rimon Winery, Recanati, Yatir, Tura, Ben Ami, Binyamina, Domaine du Castel. Israeli wineries often operate in illegal settlements or use settlement-grown grapes.
+ [Sadaf](https://boycottsadaf.com/) sources 70% of its goods from Israeli settlements, ranging from canned goods and spices to herbs and grains. These items are labeled as coming from Israel, Palestine, or sometimes other countries.

Any produce labeled “Made In Israel” including:
+ Dates from brands like Jordan River, King Solomon, Galilee Export, Carmel Agrexco, Star Dates, and more.
+ Other produce from brands like Jaffa Oranges, Mehadrin, Agrexco, Arava, Tivall, and more.

This list will be updated as the BDS movement updates targets. 

## How do I get started?

Every single one of us can have impact and it starts with our individual consumer habits, as well as the influence we may have on businesses around us.
