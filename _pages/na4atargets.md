We follow the BDS movement’s lead in strategically focusing on a small number of companies and products for maximum impact. For more information, see the [Guide to BDS Boycott and Pressure Corporate Priority Targetting](https://www.bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott) from the BDS Movement.

## What products are we boycotting? 
[List from NA4A campaign website.](https://na4a.org)

<ul>
    <li>__Sabra__:founded by Strauss group, sponsor of the IOF and “authorized supplier” to the “defense ministry” and now owned by PepsiCo (also on the BDS list!)</li>
   <li>__Israeli wines__: wineries often operate in illegal settlements or use settlement-grown grapes.</li>
    <li>__Sadaf__: USPCN has called for a boycott of this brand, who masquerade as “Middle Eastern” to infiltrate and profit off Palestinian & Arab communities while materially supporting Zionist settler economies and lobbying.</li>
</ul>

Any produce labeled “Made In Israel” including:
<ul>
    <li>__Dates__: brands like Jordan River, King Solomon, Galilee Export, Carmel Agrexco, Star Dates, and more.</li>
    <li>__Other__: brands like Jaffa Oranges, Mehadrin, Agrexco, Arava, Tivall, and more.</li>
</ul>

This list will be updated as the BDS movement updates targets.
