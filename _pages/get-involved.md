Become a [dues-paying member[(https://dsausa.org/join)] of Birmingham DSA today! We only want our members, not the ruling class, making and influencing our decisions. That's why we only want to take our members' money. Want to make and influence our decisions? [Join DSA today](https://dsausa.org/join). 

If you join, be sure to join at the <b>Monthly Solidarity Income Based Dues or Monthly Membership Movement Builder levels</b>. This is so Bham DSA gets approximately 30% of your dues deposited directly into our checking account (this doesn't happen if you pay at the yearly or one-time levels).

Pay dues yearly or one-time? Are you on a dues waiver? [Switch to monthly dues today](https://dsausa.org/join). If you pay dues at the Monthly Solidarity Income Based Dues or Monthly Membership Movement Builder levels, 30% of your dues are deposited directly into Birmingham DSA's checking account. This doesn't happen if you pay at the yearly or one-time levels <i>(if you use the same e-mail address associated with your DSA membership to start at a new level, your previous dues arrangement will be cancelled in favor of your new one)</i>.

Already pay Monthly Membership Movement Builder dues? Want to up your dues to help support our mass-movement building work? Switch to [Monthly Solidarity Income Based Dues](https://dsausa.org/join)! When you select this option at the link above, you'll see a suggested monthly dues amount based on your inputted personal annual income <i>(if you use the same e-mail address associated with your DSA membership to start at a new level, your previous dues arrangement will be  cancelled in favor of your new one)</i>.

Want another way to up your dues in support of our mass-movement building work? Pay optional [monthly local dues](https://donorbox.org/bham-dsa-monthly-dues) directly to Birmingham DSA! Approximately 90% of monthly local dues go directly into Birmingham DSA's checking account (the rest goes to payment processor fees). These are optional dues for our members, meaning it doesn't serve as the basis for your membership status.
