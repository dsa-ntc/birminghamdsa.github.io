* If you join, be sure to join at the <b>Monthly Solidarity Income Based Dues or Monthly Membership Movement Builder levels</b>. 
    * This is so Bham DSA gets approximately 30% of your dues deposited directly into our checking account (this doesn't happen if you pay at the yearly or one-time levels).

* Pay dues yearly or one-time? Are you on a dues waiver? <b>[Switch to monthly dues today](https://dsausa.org/join)</b>. 
    * If you pay dues at the Monthly Solidarity Income Based Dues or Monthly Membership Movement Builder levels, 30% of your dues are deposited directly into Birmingham DSA's checking account. This doesn't happen if you pay at the yearly or one-time levels
    * If you use the same e-mail address associated with your DSA membership to start at a new level, your previous dues arrangement will be cancelled in favor of your new one.

* Already pay Monthly Membership Movement Builder dues? Want to up your dues to help support our mass-movement building work? Switch to <b>[Monthly Solidarity Income Based Dues](https://dsausa.org/join)</b>! 
    * When you select this option at the link above, you'll see a suggested monthly dues amount based on your inputted personal annual income.
    * If you use the same e-mail address associated with your DSA membership to start at a new level, your previous dues arrangement will be cancelled in favor of your new one.

* Want another way to up your dues in support of our mass-movement building work? Pay optional <b>[monthly local dues](https://donorbox.org/bham-dsa-monthly-dues)</b> directly to Birmingham DSA!
    * Approximately 90% of monthly local dues go directly into Birmingham DSA's checking account (the rest goes to payment processor fees). 
    * These are optional dues for our members. That means this doesn't serve as the basis for your membership status.
