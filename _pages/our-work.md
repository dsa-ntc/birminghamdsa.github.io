            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Housing Justice Committee, we aim to organize tenants in and around Birmingham, with the goal of building support for tenants' rights and advocating into existence local ordinances that establish stronger tenant protections.
            
            <p>To do this, we canvass apartment complexes and other housing developments with high rates of evictions and tenant complaints, connect with tenant unions and other housing-related organizations, and more.
            
            <p>We hold meetings as needed.

            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Labor Committee, we aim to guide labor organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on workplace organizing strategies and history, strengthen relationships with existing labor organizations, and build worker power within the greater Birmingham area.

            <p>To do this, we build relationships with existing unions and other worker organizations in our region -- including <a href="https://umwa.org/about/district-20/">District 20 locals of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA)</a> and their auxiliaries, <a href="https://sbworkersunited.org/">Starbucks Workers United (SBWU)</a>, and <a href="https://bamazonunion.org/">BAmazonUnion</a> -- through strike support and community organizing. We also support new workplace organizing efforts with support from the <a href="https://workerorganizing.org/">Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC)</a>, develop labor-related educational opportunities for both our membership and the community, and much more.

            <hr>
            <p>Birmingham DSA's AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color (AFROSOC) Section advocates for and builds power with socialists who self-identify as Black, Indigenous, or Persons of Color (BIPOC) and their communities. 
            
            <p>Our goal is to affirm a space and network for BIPOC comrades to gain support, develop as leaders in DSA and in their communities, and take action.
            
            <p>We also aim to organize a mass movement of the multiracial, multiethnic working class in order to end racial capitalism, as well as all forms of material oppression based on social construction and biological existence.
            
            <p>Any person in the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa metropolitan areas who self-identify as BIPOC can become a voting member of AFROSOC. Birmingham DSA and/or DSA membership is not required to be a voting member of AFROSOC.
