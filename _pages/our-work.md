            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Labor Committee, we aim to guide labor organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on workplace organizing strategies and history, strengthen relationships with existing labor organizations, and build worker power within the greater Birmingham area.

            <p>To do this, we build relationships with existing unions and other worker organizations in our region -- including <a href="https://umwa.org/about/district-20/">District 20 locals of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA)</a> and their auxiliaries, <a href="https://sbworkersunited.org/">Starbucks Workers United (SBWU)</a>, and <a href="https://bamazonunion.org/">BAmazonUnion</a> -- through strike support and community organizing. We also support new workplace organizing efforts with support from the <a href="https://workerorganizing.org/">Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC)</a>, develop labor-related educational opportunities for both our membership and the community, and much more.
            
            <p>We hold monthly meetings.

            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Mutual Aid Committee, we aim to guide mutual aid organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on mutual aid organizing, strengthen relationships with existing mutual aid organizations, and more.
            
            <p>To do this, we organize mutual aid programs like our Brake Light Clinics, where we repair the brake light bulbs and covers of our neighbors to minimize their interactions with police, and Street Solidarity, where we prepare and enjoy hot vegetarian meals with our neighbors. Both our Brake Light Clinics and Food Action are organized in their own sub working groups, which are subdivisions of the Mutual Aid Committee.
            
            <p>We also develop mutual-aid related educational opportunities; build relationships with existing regional mutual aid organizations like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/birminghammutualaid/?hl=en">Birmingham Mutual Aid</a> and <a href="https://marginsw4bw.weebly.com/">Margins</a>; and much more.
            
            <p>We organize mutual aid events at least once a month. We hold committee meetings every month.

            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Palestine Working Group, we aim to organize Birminghamians and Tuscaloosans into solidarity actions with Palestine. We aim to form a structured coalition with other local organizations who have been focused on Palestine work and demonstrations. 
            
            <p>Our core demands include an immediate and permanent end to Israel's genocidal violence across Palestine, an end to the apartheid system that is fundamental to the Israeli ethnostate, and an end to the Israeli occupation of historic Palestine.

            <p>Our local organizing is currently focused on pressuring U.S. officials to end aid to apartheid Israel, shining a light on the global military and economic infrastructure that facilitates the occupation, and maintaining the legal and social space for Palestinian solidarity organizing to continue without repression. 
            
            <p>We hold working group meetings every 1-2 weeks.

            <p>Birmingham DSA AFROSOC Section’s mission is to end racism and capitalism, also known as racial capitalism. We recognize that racial capitalism has evolved from colonialism and imperialism, and further enables the ruling class’s exploitation of all life on this planet and the planet itself. 
            
            <p>To pursue this mission, we affirm a collective gathering space for BIPOC socialists in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa to grow, find support, organize, and take action. 
            
            <p>Any person in the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa metropolitan areas who self-identify as BIPOC can become a voting member of AFROSOC. Birmingham DSA and/or DSA membership is not required to be a voting member of AFROSOC.
