            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Labor Committee, we aim to guide labor organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on workplace organizing strategies and history, strengthen relationships with existing labor organizations, and build worker power within the greater Birmingham area.

            <p>To do this, we build relationships with existing unions and other worker organizations in our region -- including <a href="https://umwa.org/about/district-20/">District 20 locals of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA)</a> and their auxiliaries, <a href="https://sbworkersunited.org/">Starbucks Workers United (SBWU)</a>, and <a href="https://bamazonunion.org/">BAmazonUnion</a> -- through strike support and community organizing. We also support new workplace organizing efforts with support from the <a href="https://workerorganizing.org/">Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC)</a>, develop labor-related educational opportunities for both our membership and the community, and much more.
            
            <p>We hold monthly meetings.

            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Mutual Aid Committee, we aim to guide mutual aid organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on mutual aid organizing, strengthen relationships with existing mutual aid organizations, and more.
            
            <p>To do this, we organize mutual aid programs like our Brake Light Clinics, where we repair the brake light bulbs and covers of our neighbors to minimize their interactions with police, and Food Action, where we prepare and enjoy hot vegetarian meals with our neighbors. Both our Brake Light Clinics and Food Action are organized in their own sub working groups, which are subdivisions of the Mutual Aid Committee.
            
            <p>We also develop mutual-aid related educational opportunities; build relationships with existing regional mutual aid organizations like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/birminghammutualaid/?hl=en">Birmingham Mutual Aid</a> and <a href="https://marginsw4bw.weebly.com/">Margins</a>; and much more.
            
            <p>We organize mutual aid events at least once a month. We hold committee meetings every 1-2 months.

            <p>Birmingham DSA's AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color (Bham DSA AFROSOC) Section advocates for and builds power with socialists who self-identify as Black, Indigenous, or Persons of Color (BIPOC) and their communities. 
            
            <p>Our goal is to affirm a space and network for BIPOC comrades to gain support, develop as leaders in DSA and in their communities, and take action.
            
            <p>We also aim to organize a mass movement of the multiracial, multiethnic working class in order to end racial capitalism, as well as all forms of material oppression based on social construction and biological existence.
            
            <p>Any person in the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa metropolitan areas who self-identify as BIPOC can become a voting member of AFROSOC. Birmingham DSA and/or DSA membership is not required to be a voting member of AFROSOC.
