            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Immigration Working Group, we aim to to work in solidarity with immigrant communities in the greater Birmingham area by providing education, resources, and direct support.
            
            <p> We aim to address unmet needs within the existing economic, governmental, and social systems by building community power and advocating for immigrant rights. This includes through organizing events, providing transportation assistance, supporting language learning, and collaborating with other immigrant rights organizations. We also aim to make Birmingham DSA more welcoming and accessible to working-class Central Alabamians who speak a language other than English.
            
            <p>We hold biweekly meetings.

            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Labor Working Group, we aim to guide labor organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on workplace organizing strategies and history, strengthen relationships with existing labor organizations, and build worker power within the greater Birmingham area.

            <p>To do this, we build relationships with existing unions and other worker organizations in our region -- including <a href="https://umwa.org/about/district-20/">District 20 locals of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA)</a> and their auxiliaries, <a href="https://sbworkersunited.org/">Starbucks Workers United (SBWU)</a>, and <a href="https://bamazonunion.org/">BAmazonUnion</a> -- through strike support and community organizing. We also support new workplace organizing efforts with support from the <a href="https://workerorganizing.org/">Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC)</a>, develop labor-related educational opportunities for both our membership and the community, and much more.
            
            <p>We hold monthly meetings.

            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Mutual Aid Working Group, we aim to guide mutual aid organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on mutual aid organizing, strengthen relationships with existing mutual aid organizations, and more.
            
            <p>To do this, we organize mutual aid programs like our Brake Light & Fuse Replacement Clinics, where we repair the brake light bulbs, covers, and fuses of our neighbors' vehicles to minimize their interactions with police; and Street Solidarity, where we prepare meals, other material resources, and informational resources for our houseless and homeless neighbors twice a month. Both of these programs are organized in their own sub working groups, which are subdivisions of the Mutual Aid Working Group.
            
            <p>We also develop mutual-aid related educational opportunities; build relationships with existing regional mutual aid organizations like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/birminghammutualaid/?hl=en">Birmingham Mutual Aid</a>; and much more.
            
            <p>We organize mutual aid events at least once a month. We hold working group meetings every month.

            <p>As Birmingham DSA's Palestine Working Group, we aim to organize Birminghamians and Tuscaloosans into solidarity actions with Palestine. We aim to form a structured coalition with other local organizations who have been focused on Palestine work and demonstrations. 
            
            <p>Our core demands include an immediate and permanent end to Israel's genocidal violence across Palestine, an end to the apartheid system that is fundamental to the Israeli ethnostate, and an end to the Israeli occupation of historic Palestine.

            <p>Our local organizing is currently focused on pressuring U.S. officials to end aid to apartheid Israel, shining a light on the global military and economic infrastructure that facilitates the occupation, and maintaining the legal and social space for Palestinian solidarity organizing to continue without repression. 
            
            <p>We hold working group meetings every two weeks.
