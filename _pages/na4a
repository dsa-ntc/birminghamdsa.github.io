No Appetite for Apartheid is a national boycott campaign launched by the Palestine Solidarity Working Group and powered by a growing number of local grassroots coalitions. Inspired by long-standing Palestinian boycott tactics and the BDS call, we are canvassing local stores in our communities and asking them to pledge to become Apartheid Free Stores by dropping food products and companies that are complicit in the colonization of Palestine from their shelves. Itâ€™s time to turn up the heat on this apartheid regime and take apartheid off our plates with the #NoAppetiteForApartheid campaign. Information from [NA4A.ORG](na4a.org)
