[Sign the Pledge (For Businesses)](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/no-appetite-for-apartheid-business-pledge-2/) | [Sign the Pledge (For Consumers)](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/sign-the-pledge-to-join-the-campaign-and-support-apartheid-free-businesses/)

Birmingham DSA is an autonomous and democratically organized chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. The No Appetite for Apartheid campaign is being led locally by our Palestine Working Group, where we are encouraging local grocers to pledge to become Apartheid-Free Stores by dropping food products and companies that are complicit in the Israeli colonization of Palestine from their shelves. 

We are asking consumers to boycott the products on our target list and to support [local Apartheid-Free Stores](https://bhamdsa.org/apartheidfreezones). [No Appetite for Apartheid](https://na4a.org/) is a national boycott campaign launched by the [Palestine Solidarity Working Group](https://palestineswg.org/) and powered by a growing number of local grassroots coalitions (now including Birmingham DSA!)

### What does it mean to be an Apartheid-Free Business?

Being Apartheid-Free may look a little different for each business, but at a minimum we ask that you:
+ Pledge not to sell the products targeted by this boycott.
+ Pledge not to use boycott target products at your business.
+ Publicly declare yourself Apartheid-Free. We will provide you with a sign for your space, a logo for your website or social media accounts, and will add you to our list of [Apartheid-Free Zones](https://bhamdsa.org/apartheidfreezones).

You can decide how you want to participate beyond that, including:
+ Providing flyers for your customers that link to our educational materials. 
+ Hosting educational or social events related to the campaign at your business.

*We are NOT asking for donations or money from businesses.* It is completely free to commit to being Apartheid-Free!

### What products are we boycotting?

The BDS movement focuses on targeted boycotts inspired by the South African anti-apartheid movement, the US Civil Rights movement, the Indian anti-colonial struggle, and others. We follow the [BDS movement’s](https://bdsmovement.net/BDS-Guide-Strategic-Campaigning) lead in strategically focusing on a small number of companies and products for maximum impact. [We need to target companies that play a clear and direct role in Israel’s crimes and where there is real potential for impact.](https://www.bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott)
