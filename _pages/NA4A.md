No Appetite for Apartheid is a national boycott campaign launched by the Palestine Solidarity Working Group and powered by a growing number of local grassroots coalitions. 

Birmingham DSA is canvassing local stores in our community and asking them to pledge to become Apartheid-Free Zones by dropping food products and companies that are complicit in the colonization of Palestine from their shelves. We are asking consumers to boycott the products on our target list, and to support local Apartheid Free Stores.

## What does it mean to be an Apartheid-Free Business?

Being Apartheid-Free may look a little different for each business, but at a minimum we ask that you:
+ Pledge not to sell the products targeted by this boycott.
+ Pledge not to use boycott target products at your business.
+ Publicly declare yourself Apartheid-Free. We will provide you with a sign for your space, a logo for your website or social media accounts, and will add you to our list of [Apartheid-Free Zones](https://bhamdsa.org/na4atargets).

You can decide how you want to participate beyond that, including:
+ Providing flyers for your customers that link to our educational materials. 
+ Hosting educational or social events related to the campaign at your business. 

## What products are we boycotting?

The BDS movement focuses on targeted boycotts inspired by the South African anti-apartheid movement, the US Civil Rights movement, the Indian anti-colonial struggle, and others. We follow the [BDS movement’s](https://bdsmovement.net/BDS-Guide-Strategic-Campaigning) lead in strategically focusing on a small number of companies and products for maximum impact. [We need to target companies that play a clear and direct role in Israel’s crimes and where there is real potential for impact.](https://www.bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott)

## What happens after I sign the pledge?

If you’re a business owner, we’ll follow up with you soon after you sign to provide you with a sticker and poster for your business and a logo for your website, then we'll add you to our list of businesses that have joined the campaign!
